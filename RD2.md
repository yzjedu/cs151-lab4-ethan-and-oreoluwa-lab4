The objective of this project was to develop a mobile subscription billing system that accurately calculates total costs based on various package types, data usage, and the applicability of coupons. Through this exercise, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of how to structure code for conditional calculations, while also ensuring that the outputs were precise and reliable across different scenarios.

To accomplish this, I began by outlining the requirements for the billing system, identifying the different package types and their associated costs. I then implemented the logic using a programming language, focusing on conditional statements to compute costs based on user inputs. After writing the initial code, I created a series of test cases in Excel to verify the accuracy of the calculations, checking both the total costs before and after coupon application. This iterative process allowed me to refine my code, particularly in handling edge cases and ensuring robust error management.

Overall, the results were in line with my expectations. The calculations performed accurately for standard test cases, and I successfully integrated the coupon logic. I also explored various test cases, including extreme scenarios like maximum data usage, which helped ensure the reliability of the program.

Throughout this process, I encountered challenges, particularly in applying coupon discounts correctly for edge cases where totals were close to the discount thresholds and figuring how to to implement unlimited data for the purple package. Debugging these issues required significant attention. I focused on following the first three rules of programming: keeping the logic simple, testing early and often, and refactoring regularly. By adopting these principles, I was able to break down the problem efficiently and refine my code iteratively, making it more readable and maintainable.

Collaborating with my partner proved to be an invaluable part of the experience. We divided tasks according to our strengths and communicated openly about our challenges, which helped us navigate the debugging process more effectively. This teamwork not only made the project more engaging but also enhanced our problem-solving capabilities. In conclusion, I feel that I achieved the learning objectives of this lab, gaining both practical coding experience and a better understanding of collaborative work in programming.
