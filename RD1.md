Objective
In this lab, I was supposed to learn how to work with string methods, decision-making, and input validation using loops. The main goal was to calculate a customer’s monthly bill based on their chosen mobile package and data usage. We needed to apply logical boolean operators and formatting methods, like f-string formatting, to ensure accurate results. Additionally, the lab aimed to improve my skills in creating algorithms and flowcharts to visualize control paths before coding.
Procedure
To solve the problem, we followed several steps:
1. We first analyzed the requirements to understand what each package offered and the conditions for applying discounts, specifically for the green package.
2. We worked on our excel test cases, to map out the different possibilities for results.
3. We wrote an algorithm that outlined each step the program would take, from accepting user input to calculating additional charges and validating inputs.
4. We tailored the algorithm to ensure it handled all possible cases, including invalid inputs and package names typed in various formats. We aimed to create a general approach that was flexible and not overly specific for any single scenario, ensuring the code was adaptable and efficient.
5. Before coding, we designed a flowchart using draw.io to visualize the program’s flow and control paths, helping us see how each decision point worked within the program.
6. We coded the program according to the algorithm, ensuring the conditions for each package were clearly implemented, and I applied input validation to handle different user inputs.
7. We created a list of test cases in Excel to test the program’s responses to boundary values and extreme cases, such as minimal and high data usage scenarios.
8. Finally, we tested the code thoroughly, using the test cases to confirm it handled all inputs and scenarios correctly, then fixed any errors and tested again.
The key concepts explored included loops for input validation, logical operators for condition checking, and string methods to standardize user input.

Results
Our results matched my expectations. The program accurately calculated costs for all packages and applied the coupon discount when relevant. We tested various scenarios, including extreme cases, and the program correctly handled them all. The output consistently displayed the price rounded to two decimal places, as required.
Reflection
One significant challenge was ensuring the algorithm could handle all cases, particularly invalid inputs or varied formats for package names. To overcome this, we tailored the algorithm to be flexible and not overly specific. We used string methods like .lower() to standardize inputs, allowing the program to recognize package names regardless of how they were typed. This made the program more robust and adaptable.

Following the first three rules of programming, we:
1. Planned and identified the problem by thoroughly understanding the requirements and working meticulously on the algorithm before coding. We ensured the algorithm was general enough to account for all scenarios, which streamlined the coding process later.
2. Designed the solution using a flowchart that mapped the control paths clearly, allowing us to visualize and refine the program’s structure before coding.
3. Tested the program multiple times with various test cases, including edge cases, to validate its performance and accuracy. Each test allowed us to fine-tune the code and confirm it worked as expected across all possible inputs.
Working with my partner, Oro, was a great experience. We communicated well and divided tasks based on our strengths. I focused on our test-cases and algorithm, while Oro focused on refining the algorithm and the programming itself. We encountered bugs with input validation but resolved them by collaborating and systematically reviewing the code line by line.

I believe I gained a solid understanding of the intended concepts for this lab, particularly input validation and decision-making. This experience showed the value of planning thoroughly before coding, designing the flow, and testing rigorously to ensure our solution was effective and adaptable.
